# git-crew configuration

## Workers configuration
# [workers]
# default = "<<.DefaultWorker>>"  # Default worker to use when starting tasks
# system_prompt = <<.WorkersSystemPrompt>> # System prompt (automatically set by crew)
# prompt = <<.WorkersPrompt>>               # User custom instructions (added after system_prompt)

## Built-in worker customization
## - args: user-customizable arguments (e.g., logging verbosity)
## - model: default model name for this worker (overrides built-in default)
## - system_prompt: override the common system prompt for this worker
## - prompt: override the common prompt for this worker
## - system_args: auto-applied for crew operation (rarely need to change)
## - command: base command to run
## - command_template: how to assemble the full command
##   Available: {{.Command}}, {{.SystemArgs}}, {{.Args}}, {{.Prompt}}

# [workers.claude]
# args = "<<.ClaudeArgs>>"

# [workers.opencode]
# args = "<<.OpencodeArgs>>"
# model = "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5"

## Custom worker example
# [workers.my-worker]
# command_template = "{{.Command}} {{.Args}} {{.Prompt}}"
# command = "my-custom-agent"
# args = "--task"
# prompt = "Complete the task and run 'crew complete'"

## Worker inheritance example
## You can inherit from another worker and override specific fields.
## Useful for creating model variants with different settings.
# [workers.claude-hard]
# inherit = "claude"  # Inherit all settings from the "claude" worker
# model = "anthropic/claude-opus-4"
#
# [workers.claude-easy]
# inherit = "claude"
# model = "anthropic/claude-haiku"

## CI gate on completion
# [complete]
# command = "mise run ci"

## Diff display settings
## - command: Shell command to display diff. Supports template variables:
##   - {{.BaseBranch}}: Task's base branch (e.g., "main")
##   - {{.Args}}: Additional arguments passed to the diff command
##   The command runs from the worktree directory.
## - tui_command: Command for TUI diff display (optional)
# [diff]
# command = "git diff {{.BaseBranch}}...HEAD{{if .Args}} {{.Args}}{{end}}"
# tui_command = "git diff --color {{.BaseBranch}}...HEAD | less -R"

## Log settings
# [log]
# level = "<<.LogLevel>>"  # debug, info, warn, error

## Manager configuration
## Managers are read-only agents for task orchestration.
## They can create and monitor tasks but delegate code to workers.
# [managers.default]
# agent = "opencode"  # Agent to use (builtin: claude, opencode)
# model = ""          # Model override (optional)
# args = ""           # Additional arguments (optional)
