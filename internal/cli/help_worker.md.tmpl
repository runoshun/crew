# git-crew Worker Guide

Guide for worker agents executing tasks in worktrees.

---

## Basic Operations

### Check Task Information
```bash
crew show              # Show current task details
```

### Report Progress
```bash
crew comment <id> "<message>"   # Add a comment
```

Add comments in these situations:
- When you need user input or clarification on important decisions
- When you encounter blockers or unexpected issues
- When the task is complete (summary of what was done)

### Complete Task
```bash
crew complete          # Mark task as complete
```

---

## Resolving Conflicts

When conflicts occur with main branch:

```bash
# Fetch and merge main (use main, NOT origin/main)
git fetch origin main:main
git merge main

# After resolving conflicts
git add <files>
git commit
```

**Important**: Use `main`, not `origin/main`.

---

## CI Tests

Run CI after making changes:

```bash
mise run ci            # Run tests, lint, and build
```

---

## Typical Workflow

```bash
# 1. Check task information
crew show

# 2. Implement changes

# 3. Run CI
mise run ci

# 4. Commit changes
git add <files>
git commit -m "feat: ..."

# 5. Complete task
crew complete
```

## Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `crew show` | Show task details |
| `crew complete` | Mark task as complete |
| `crew comment` | Add a comment |
| `crew diff` | Show diff |

---

## Agent Configuration Tips

- Repository owners can set per-worker defaults in `.git/crew/config.toml` using the `model = "<provider/model>"` field.
- `crew start -m <model>` overrides the config value when a specific model is required.

## Prohibited Actions

| Action | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| `git push` | Reviewer pushes when merging |
| `git push --force` | Risk of data loss |
