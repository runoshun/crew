# Dev Workflow

Follow AGENTS.md Development Flow, tracking progress with TodoWrite.

## TODO Management

At the start of each task, register ALL steps as TODOs:

```
- [ ] Read docs/README.md
- [ ] Check TASKS.md for current task  
- [ ] Create feature branch
- [ ] <Implementation step 1>
- [ ] <Implementation step 2>
- [ ] ...
- [ ] Test: mise run ci
- [ ] Update TASKS.md checkboxes
- [ ] Commit (on user request)
```

## Rules

1. Register ALL steps as TODOs before starting
2. Update TODO status in real-time as you work
3. Only ONE item in progress at a time
